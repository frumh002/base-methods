# Methods Repository

This repository is the host of my development and notes with causal inference, regression, econometrics, and sample R code.

I have done extensive linking of resources and citations but I heavily rely on the following resources:

- Miguel Hern√°n and James Robins ["What If"](https://miguelhernan.org/whatifbook)
- Scott Cunningham's ["The Mixtap"](https://mixtape.scunning.com/)
- Schwartz and Prins ["Causal Inference and the People's Health"](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/causal-inference-and-the-peoples-health-9780197528587?cc=us&lang=en&)
